Dear maintainer,

Please see the problems shown on
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_shinytest2.html>.

Please correct before 2023-02-21 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

```

I believe the installation error is a false-positve as it is a permission issue:

```
# File: /home/hornik/tmp/R.check/r-devel-gcc/Work/PKGS/shinytest2.Rcheck/00install.out
# Link: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc/shinytest2-00check.html

* Addressed the NOTE about C++11 by dropping the System Requirements field from the DESCRIPTION file.
  * https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest2/pull/326
* I have tried to address the NOTE about the extra Crashpad file/directory, but I can not reproduce this locally or on my test machines.
  * https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest2/pull/327/commits/badef8c
* I believe the installation error is a false-positve as it is a permission issue on the machine.

I have included other small bug fixes.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information.

Thank you,
Barret

Dear maintainers,

This concerns the CRAN packages

  shiny.benchmark shinytest2

maintained by one of you:

  Barret Schloerke <barret@rstudio.com>: shinytest2
  Douglas Azevedo <opensource+douglas@appsilon.com>: shiny.benchmark

We have asked for an update fixing the check problems shown at
  <https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_shinytest2.html>
with no update from the maintainer thus far.

Thus, package shinytest2 is now scheduled for archival on 2023-03-07,
and archiving this will necessitate also archiving its CRAN strong
reverse dependencies.

Please negotiate the necessary actions.

The CRAN Team
